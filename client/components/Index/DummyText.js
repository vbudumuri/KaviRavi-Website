const DummyText = () => "If we had to tell one thing about us.. it would be that we’re so thankful. Thankful that God brought us together. We’re so excited to be getting married and most of all excited to share our lives with one another. Great things really started happening in our lives when irrespective of the backgrounds, talent brought us together for doing masters at Arizona State University. It was the typical meet and greet parties where we started to get to know each other. A few weeks went by, and both being inquisitive about technology and the happenings in the university, we decided to hang out. We continued to know about each other and realized we have great compatibility. It was inevitable, we couldn’t stay friends for very long - we started dating from mid 2015 and have been having a blast together ever since! Together, we bring out each others’ best parts and inspire each other. We are truly blessed. We look forward to creating a lifetime of memories together, especially with you — our family and friends!"
